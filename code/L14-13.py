# Here's another chance to practice your for loop skills. Write code for the 
# function word_in_pos (meaning word in parts_of_speech), which takes in a string 
# word and a list parts_of_speech as inputs. If there is a word in parts_of_speech
# that is a substring of the variable word, then return that word in parts_of_speech, 
# else return None.



def word_in_pos(word, parts_of_speech):
	theWord = ''.join([i for i in word if i.isalpha()])
#	print theWord
	for i in parts_of_speech:
		if(i.find(theWord)>=0):
			return theWord
	return None


test_cases = ["NOUN", "FALSE", "<<@PERSON><", "PLURALNOUN"]
parts_of_speech = ["PERSON", "PLURALNOUN", "NOUN"]

print word_in_pos(test_cases[0], parts_of_speech)
print word_in_pos(test_cases[1], parts_of_speech)
print word_in_pos(test_cases[2], parts_of_speech)
print word_in_pos(test_cases[3], parts_of_speech)
